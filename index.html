    <h2> Hello New Friends! </h2>
    <h3>So why did I decide to use my CS50 assignment to make a webpage about personal finance?</h3>
    <p class= "explain" id="why">
        The year I was born my mother put in $3,000 into a investment account for me that she decided not to touch until I turned 18.
        Once I turned 18, she turned this account over to me and I learned that over time that $3,000 had grown to nearly $12,000.
        There was no day trading involved, just a one time investment into an index fund that grew and compounded over time. <br>
        Since then, I have become very interested in the personal finance space and have become rather nerdy about the topic along the way.
        As I learned more, I wanted to help others gain the personal finance education that I was so lucky to have received from my family.
        This has led to me talking often about the topic to anyone that will listen. I have also been known to spend whole days researching
        different tax advantaged investment accounts across Canada, the UK and France to help educate international friends.<br>
        This site is an expansion of that interest and one day, I might like to build it out further to create more educational resources.
        Until then, feel free to use this site to learn more about finance terms, play with a compound interest calculator, or view my
        recommendations for personal finance educators that I have learned from.
